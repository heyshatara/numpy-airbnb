# Amsterdam AirBnB Booking Analysis
Data Cleansing with Python, NumPy 
Starting now, you are the Lead Data Scientist for the Amsterdam area at Airbnb! Your job is to manage Airbnb in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We'll analyze real data from different listings along with related data, and make decisions on how we can structure our data.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this data science portfolio project, I utilized Python and NumPy to clean and analyze a dataset containing booking information for AirBnB locations in Amsterdam. The objective of this project was to clean the dataset, convert its currency and aggregate calculations. The resulting dataset was then used to develop a recommendation system to enable tourists to identify the best AirBnB listing based on proximity to locations they planned to visit in Amsterdam.
